these are some custom ublock origin filters to be installed at "filter lists" -> "custom"

you can put urls here by linking directly to the raw text file like:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9kosho/ublock-focus-filters/refs/heads/main/general.txt`

(on github, there is a "Raw" button you can click on when viewing the file to find this link)

then if you update this file, the changes should propagate to whatever accounts you have subscribing to the filter file

---

the `focus` file is if you want to eliminate all distractions and break functionality for distraction websites

the `general` file is for eliminating annoying UI elements on twitter (x) by taking out the sidebar elements
it also eliminates the shorts stuff that appears on YouTube and breaks the playing of shorts videos on YouTube
